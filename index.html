                <h1>About Us</h1>

                <p>
                    Welcome to Rug Wrangler, a unique youthful entrepreneurship journey, nestled in the heart of Cochrane, Alberta. Our story begins with a partnership between a young entrepreneur, Eli Cloutier, and his mother-in-law, Michelle Sauvageau.
                </p>
                <P>
                    Eli, an emerging entrepreneur, started his first business at the age of 9, founding a firewood selling company. With a keen sense for business and a relentless drive, he re-invested the money he made with firewood to ventured into the world of gourmet treats, launching a caramel treats venture at 10 years old. Each endeavor not only added to his experience but also to his aspiration to become a better entrepreneur.
                </p>
                <P>
                    At 12, Eli, together with Michelle, founded Rug Wrangler. Our company is built on the foundation of Eli's youthful energy and Michelle's strategic support, creating a dynamic duo that is both ambitious and grounded.
                </p>
                <P>
                    Our mission is to help reduce the cost of living and working in a clean and healthy environment. We believe in the power of combining different perspectives and experiences to offer an amazing service to our customers.
